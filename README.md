## Simulating a country's replacement rate
With countries like South Korea hitting historically low birth rates, I thought it would be interesting to create a simple visualizer for education's sake. Hopefully this tool can be expanded on to be a proper educational device.

Low birth rates result in an ageing population; that is, a growth in the senior population and possibly a shrinkage in the young workforce. This strains the country's budget as productive young taxpayers are no longer able to fund social services.

I think it would be an interesting future endeavour to simulate age and gender; the current simulator is quite simple. A population graph is informative, but a gender/age pyramid might be far moreso!
